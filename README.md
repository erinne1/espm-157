## Sixth Mass Extinction?

Earth is 4.6 billion years old and extinctions are a normal part of 
We validate for ourselves whether the notion species are being lost at a 1000 times the background rate is true. 
In this module we focus on the past 500 years using public information but with parsing data through request and retrieval.  

## Newly introduced focus: Application Programming Interface (API)
By essentially pinging
A RESTful API supports formats like HTML, Json, text, Xml. It is commonly used by businesses, web applications to access data from other useful applications.

### Important packages
- `httr`: performs API requests for information
- `jsonlite`: converting objects from json into R
- `purrr`: loops over lists   
- `tidyverse`: string match pattern identifiers
- `dplyr`, `ggplot`: graph plotting


### Red List site 
- https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs International Union for Conservation of Nature

## Findings
In order for a period of time to be considered a mass extinction, we can test if over 75% of species are on the projection towards extinction within a 'geologically short time' as well as compare the rate of extinction against the expected background rate of extinction.
